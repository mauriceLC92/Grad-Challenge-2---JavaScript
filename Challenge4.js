/*
Challenge 4 - Indexing & Searching

We have a large array of users which are comprised of 3 different user types ("Admin", "Moderator", "User").
Each user will have the following properties: ("name", "companyId", "type").

Your first method will take 1 parameter: an array of users and must return a grouped list according to the user property "type".

The second method will take 4 parameters: a grouped list (result from the first method), an array of user types to include in the search,
a string representing the user property to filter by and a string representing the value of the user property. 
This method must return an array of users as per the search parameters.
